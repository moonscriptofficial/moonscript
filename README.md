## Overview

Welcome to **MoonScript**, the next-generation, full-stack web programming language designed for **simplicity**, **speed**, and **efficiency**! üöÄ

With **MoonScript**, you can develop dynamic and scalable web applications with **ease** and **speed**. The syntax is intuitive, and compilation times are drastically reduced, making development faster than ever before. It is tailored to help developers build modern, interactive web apps, and is packed with powerful features that ensure your projects stay lightweight and performant.

---

## Features

- üî• **Low Compilation Time**: MoonScript compiles faster than traditional frameworks, thanks to its lightweight and optimized architecture.
- üöÄ **Faster Execution**: Code written in **MoonScript** runs **faster** compared to others, thanks to its low-level optimizations.
- üåç **Cross-Platform Support**: Seamlessly write applications that can run on all platforms with minimal code changes.
- üß© **Component-Based Design**: Write reusable, self-contained components with the same structure you use for HTML and CSS.
- üíª **Web Focused**: Perfect for building both the **frontend** and **backend** of modern web applications.
- üé® **CSS-Inspired Styling**: Writing styles has never been easier, as our syntax for styles is directly influenced by CSS. You‚Äôll feel right at home if you‚Äôre familiar with web design.

## Example Syntax

Here's a simple component written in **MoonScript** that demonstrates how easy it is to define components, properties, and styles:

```ruby
component HelloWorld {
  property color = "#333"
  property done = false
  property label = ""

  style label {
    font-weight: bold;
    color: #{color};
    flex: 1;

    if (done) {
      text-decoration: line-through;
    }
  }

  fun render {
    <div>
      <span::label>
        label
      </span>
    </div>
  }
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Component Definition**: The `component TodoItem` block defines a reusable component that encapsulates all its properties, styling, and behavior.
- **Properties**: Properties like `color`, `done`, and `label` are defined within the component and can be accessed throughout the component's lifecycle.
- **Styling**: The `style` block defines how elements inside the component will look. It‚Äôs similar to CSS, but with more power and flexibility.
- **Render Function**: The `fun render` function is where the UI elements are rendered using the component's properties and styling.
